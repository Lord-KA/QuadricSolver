# Quadric Solver

This is an educational task of creating a quadric equations solver with NCurses interface.

## Building
```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$ make
```

## DONE
1. Quadric solver logic
2. Cute NCurses windows
3. Parabola plot listing
4. Pseudo terminal window with history recovery support (KEY_UP/DOWN!)
5. Some GoogleTests
6. Doxygen docs
7. Cmake config with googleTest fetching

## TODO
1. Fix some bugs in pseudo-terminal
2. Add other tiers of equation solving and plotting
3. Add differentiation support
4. Integrate Wolfram Mathematica API
5. Sell to Wolfram Research Inc
